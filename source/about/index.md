Herbs serve a range of purposes and are used in many various things. While some persons believe that some herbal remedies are specialized and sacred, others use natural herbs for cosmetics or medications or for culinary purposes. Culinary herbs in smaller amounts provide flavour instead of substance to food.

As for plant based cosmetics, mixtures and pastes were sometimes used to whiten the face in the olden times. Now, on the other hand, herbal-based cosmetics come in many varieties, such as face lotions, scrubs, lipsticks, natural fragrances, and body natural oils.
