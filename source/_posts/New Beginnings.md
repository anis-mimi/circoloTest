First, I would like to apologize… it’s been a very long time since I've posted on this blog… I’ve been tangled up with starting and growing another business.

This is the time to bring A Voyage into Herbal & Natural Curing Blog back to lifestyle!  I’ve began on a complete redesign which I’m sure you will all like.  Inspiring.  But, I also need to go through all my posts, check for and modify any wording that is not in compliance with FDA regulations.  Bummer.  A significant shame that herbal products have been used throughout record as medicine, approach before pharmaceuticals, and today we can’t mention specific healing benefits connected with them because that classifies them as a “medicine” and provides the FDA authority to regulate.  Crazy.

So, there are adjustments brewing at A Voyage into Herbal & Natural Healing… just might take a bit.
