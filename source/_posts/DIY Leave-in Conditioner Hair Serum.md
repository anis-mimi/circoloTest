## How To Make Ypur Hair Moisture

The great thing about making your own hair serum recipe is that you will get to customize the feel and smell every time you refill your important bottle of botanical ingredients. I commonly sway toward jojoba and argan oil, for my gently coarse, frizzy hair, which tends to stay dried out and oil-free, no matter how much oil I add to it. This allows me to renew my look without going for a brush to my wild hair - that may just destroy curls.

Jojoba essential oil (Simmondsia chinensis) which is truly a wax, may be the closest oil to our body’s naturally produced sebum, which may be the fifty percent of why it won’t cause you to feel greasy.  That is especially great essential oil for oily wild hair types. Since it’s easy to come to be absorbed not only by your hair but as well by your skin, this makes it probably the most popular additions to facial essential oil serum recipes too.

Argan essential oil (Argania spinosa) is golden found in colour with a subtle aroma.  This oil contains supplement E, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids, which your locks will love!

It is the base I use for most of my hair serum recipes, sometimes I put in a little rosehip seed oil, or a dab of pomegranate seed oil in the wintertime. I regularly change the essential oils I take advantage of, but Rosemary and Lavender will be a few of my favourites.

### Wild Hair Moisturiser Recipe For All Head of Hair Types
1 - 1oz bottle
1 Tbsp Organic and natural Argan Oil

5 drops Rosemary GAS
5 drops Lavender GAS

__Directions:__
*1. Combine oils and fundamental oils into glass bottle with dropper leading.*
*2. Screw on cap and roll bottle between palms to disperse necessary oils.*
*3. With dry hair: Place several drops onto fingertips, tell you mid to get rid of of hair. I prevent adding oils to scalp immediately, as this is where oil can have a tendency to build up.*
*4. With wet hair:  Place a couple of drops into finger tips and tell you mid to end of hair,  brush through while even now wet and style as ordinary.*
