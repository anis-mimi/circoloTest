While herbs are referred to as leafy greens or flowering elements of a plant, fresh or dried, spices, alternatively, are produced from the other parts of the plants, which usually are dried, including berries, roots, barks, seeds, and fruits.

Generally use, herbs are being used for food, flavouring, remedies, or fragrances because of their savoury and aromatic homes.
